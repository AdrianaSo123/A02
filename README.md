Branch- a separate copy of your code; it does not affect the work you have already done

Clone- this is when you duplicate the information from your repository from gitHub onto your local machine instead of the website's server

Commit- when you commit, it saves your work so you can keep a record of what changes are being made in each version

Fetch- this is when you add changes from the remote repository to your local branch without having to commit them

GIT- an open source program that allows you to save your work to your machine

Github- a version control website that allows your to save your code

Merge- taking the changes from one branch and applying it to another (it can also combine several different commits)

Merge Conflict- when the two versions of code do not work together

Push- when you send your committed changes to a repository on Github

Pull- when you fetch changes to merge them

Remote- version of the repository that is not saved on the local machine, but rather a server like Github

Repository- this is essentially a new project in gitHub, which stores all the information for a specific project


first you have to commit to git and then share to github
then open github and make sure you can see the respository with the code
then clock on settings-> pages (on the left)
    then put master branch and save
    you will see an error message but make sure you add the index (my-first-web-page.html)
